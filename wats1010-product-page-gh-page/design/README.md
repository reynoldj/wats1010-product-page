Part One: Product Page Design Phase
-----------------------------------

The Design Phase is where you must create some **design artifacts** (wireframes,
comps, information architecture diagrams, etc.) in order to guide your building
over the next week.

You must also decide what text you will use and where you will use it.
Incorporate the exact text you will use in your wireframes so you can get an
idea of how much room it will take up and how it will read when positioned
relative to other content.

Be sure to make a place for the explainer video. (The company spent a lot of
money on it, and they want it to be featured prominently.)

**Requirements**

1.  Create a PDF wireframe of the page layout with exact text that will be used.
2.  Choose and edit the text you will use according to your vision for the
product page.
3.  Create at least one other project planning document. You may choose from
this list:
        * information architecture diagram
        * project timeline (represented in any way)
        * design comps
