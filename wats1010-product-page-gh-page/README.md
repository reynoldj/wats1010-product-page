wats1010-product-page
=====================

This repository contains the resources to use for the Imaginary Product Page
assignment in WATS1010: Introduction to Web Development. In this project you
are tasked with creating a single-page site to promote a product: The API
Superstore. The API Superstore is a **fictional company** that offers a
catalog interface to APIs. To be honest, don't try to make too much technical
sense of it all: This is a completely useless company and product in many ways.

But that makes it all the more fun, right?

As you work through this project, you will address six different
requirements:

1. Introduce the product
2. Provide access to the explainer video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L48g1ZWLMdo)
3. List features
4. Provide user testimonials
5. Provide ability for users to share links to the product page
6. Call to action link to get user to buy product

To work through all these requirements and create an elegant page, the larger
project is broken into a few smaller Project Assignments. Below each phase
of the project is described.

Part One: Product Page Design Phase
-----------------------------------

The Design Phase is where you must create some **design artifacts** (wireframes,
comps, information architecture diagrams, etc.) in order to guide your building
over the next week.

You must also decide what text you will use and where you will use it.
Incorporate the exact text you will use in your wireframes so you can get an
idea of how much room it will take up and how it will read when positioned
relative to other content.

Be sure to make a place for the explainer video. (The company spent a lot of
money on it, and they want it to be featured prominently.)

**Requirements**

1.  Create a PDF wireframe of the page layout with exact text that will be used.
2.  Choose and edit the text you will use according to your vision for the
    product page.
3.  Create at least one other project planning document. You may choose from
    this list:

    * information architecture diagram
    * project timeline (represented in any way)
    * design comps
    * any images or illustrations you are planning to add to the site

All of these documents should be placed in the design folder.

Part Two: Product Page Preview
------------------------------

The Product Page Preview is really just a check-in point on your build process.
It's common to put up work that is in-progress for feedback from the team and
your clients. Since we are spending two weeks to build out this page, we should
take the time to post up stuff and see how things are coming together.

For this phase, in addition to your Status Update Report as described in the
course shell, your only website deliverable is the in-progress site deployed to
Github Pages.

**Requirements**

1.  In-progress site build deployed to the ``gh-pages`` branch and visible on
    your user.github.io site.
2.  Demonstrated progress on:

    * The video should be embedded
    * You should have your content placed into the page
    * You should have partial styles applied to the page

Part Three: Product Page
------------------------

Your final product should be a finished, polished Product Page. This is a very
common style of page, and you should strive to create a page that fits into the
style and approach of other long-scroll product pages.

Pay a lot of attention to the details here. You have two weeks to build, so
be sure to take care of the small items and track down solutions to issues. It's
better to pull back on ambition in order to create something more polished.

Be sure you have addressed the six primary requirements of the page:

1. Introduce the product
2. Provide access to the explainer video
3. List features
4. Provide user testimonials
5. Provide ability for users to share links to the product page
6. Call to action link to get user to buy product

Notes About Assets
---------------------

This repository contains an ``assets`` folder that has logos for the company,
the source text, and some additional assets you may wish to use. You are not
limited to these assets, and you have probably not been provided with all the
assets you will need to make your page look great. You are expected to seek
out elements that fit with your design goals and use them appropriately.

**Video Explainer**

The video explainer for the API Superstore is located here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L48g1ZWLMdo You should follow the YouTube embed
directions to embed the video into the page with appropriate settings and
size. Take into account the sizes YouTube will let you use to embed the video
so you can design around those constraints.

**Bootstrap CSS Framework**

You have been provided with the Bootstrap CSS Framework
(http://getbootstrap.com) linked into your HTML
file. This framework gives you a range of styles you can leverage if you choose.
You can use Bootstrap styles to accomplish a wide range of goals, and it can
help you get a more professional feeling in your site.

Bootstrap can be both a blessing and a curse. It will make some things very
easy, but you may find yourself having trouble overriding some elements of the
style if you veer away from what the framework does by default. This is the
tradeoff of using a robust framework like this.

Note: You are NOT obligated to use Bootstrap. If you feel it is too much to
think about on this assignment, you are free to ignore it (just remove the
``link`` tags in the ``head`` of your index.html) or replace it with another
CSS framework. (There are dozens.)
